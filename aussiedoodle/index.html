        Aussiedoodles quickly capture the hearts of their families and others
        that meet them, one of the standout features of the Aussiedoodle is
        their coat, which often inherits the Poodle's hypoallergenic qualities
        and the Australian Shepherd's striking appearance. Their coat can range
        from curly to wavy, and it requires regular grooming to keep it in top
        shape.
