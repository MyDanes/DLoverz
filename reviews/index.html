        Doodle Dandy Review: Wow, what great service we have received from
        Susan!! I did not expect to be able to ask so many questions before and
        after adoption. We are so grateful for the tips and tricks! We also LOVE
        the Congrats file!! It is so full of information! We have referenced it
        time and time again! The gift bag is so generous as well. The Snuggle
        Puppy is such a huge blessing because our puppy sleeps and naps with it
        all the time. We really believe that helped our transition to home –
        especially because he was already used to it! The blanket that smells
        like their litter is also so wonderful. We have adopted a pup from
        another breeder before and the service was NOTHING like Susan’s. We
        received a small blanket when we left and that was nice, but they had
        Snuggle Puppies for sale (not as a gift). They would also not allow us
        to be in contact with other families that adopted from the same litter.
        The breeder contact mentioned there was another puppy adopted to our
        same town but they did not allow us to contact each other. It just felt
        very cold and sterile – nothing like Susan and Doodle Dandy. We
        appreciate that Susan is as available as we’d like her to be, she has
        always been very reachable and transparent. She’s also encouraged us to
        engage with other families. It’s so nice that we don’t have to feel as
        though she’s hiding something. So refreshing!!! Thank you, Susan!

        FIVE Stars... Susan changed my life with such an amazing pup. And thank
        you Chip and PZ for bringing Blitzen into this world. Susan's family
        went above and beyond ~ her son and friend drove Blitzen all the way to
        IL. I can tell her family raises their pups with a lot of love and
        attention. When we met Blitzen (3 mo. old) he would rest his nose on my
        nose and lock eyes the whole ride. Soon as we brought him home he would
        not stop with kisses :) Also ran through a tunnel (for agility training)
        without any training! Cannot wait to have fun with him and watch him
        grow. Susan included a gift bag that was perfect for the ride home
        (Blitzen loves sleeping on the cooling pad that has his mom's scent). We
        noticed my sister's dog was not shaking in the car for the first time
        because Blitzen was a role model - very calm in the car. They look like
        father and son, and are starting to mimic each other. Very grateful to
        Susan for this beautiful pup. When I wake up next to him and his
        "blizzard" hair I'm so grateful..

        I found Susan through Good dog. I wanted to find a aussiedoodleer that
        was careful not to “overaussiedoodle” and really treated the puppies
        like a lover of dogs. Susan was very responsive to all my questions. She
        could answer all my questions without hesitation and it was clear she
        knew the Aussie doodle aussiedoodle. She worked with me on a date for
        pick up and was flexible when I needed to change that date. She
        FaceTimed me to allow me to see my puppy’s behavior & personality. I am
        very happy with Susan & with my sweet little Harper. She is happy, calm,
        & so loving. Very pleased with my sweet little girl!

        Our experience with Susan at Doodle Dandy was nothing short of
        wonderful! From the moment we began the process of bringing Oakley home,
        Susan was there every step of the way. She kept us informed with
        constant updates, sent photos, and answered all our questions
        thoroughly. It’s clear she truly cares about each puppy and each family
        she works with. Susan even went above and beyond to personally bring
        Oakley to us in Florida, making sure the transition was smooth. Now that
        Oakley is here, we’re completely smitten! He has the sweetest, calmest
        personality but is still so playful and fun. It’s obvious that Susan’s
        love and care have shaped him into the perfect addition to our family.
        We’re so grateful to Susan for her dedication, and we’d wholeheartedly
        recommend Doodle Dandy to anyone searching for their perfect pup!
